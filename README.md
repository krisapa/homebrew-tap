This repo is a [Homebrew tap](https://docs.brew.sh/Taps) (3rd party repository) for my code. 

You need to have `brew` installed: [Homebrew installation](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation)

Check out: [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).


You can install individual formulae/casks by running the following command:

```shell
brew install 6b70/tap/<formula>
```

You can also add my tap as a repository locally by running

```shell
brew tap 6b70/tap
```

Then you can then install by running `brew install <formula>`.
